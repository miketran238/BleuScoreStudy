\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, in this work, we invalidated the use of BLEU for code migration. We showed counterexamples to prove that BLEU is not effective in reflecting the semantic accuracy of translated code and in comparing different SMT-based migration systems. Our empirical study illustrated that BLEU has weak correlation with human judgment in the task of measuring semantics of translated source code. Also, BLEU's conclusion about the difference between models' translation quality is inconsistent with semantic score's one. We concluded that BLEU is not suitable for source code migration, and proposed a new alternative metric {\model} to replace BLEU. {\model} is a novel ensemble metric that takes into account three representation levels of source code. We validated {\model} on multiple practical Code Migration systems to show its reliability in estimating semantic accuracy and comparing translation quality between systems.
