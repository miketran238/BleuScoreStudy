\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we invalidated the use of BLEU for code migration. We
showed counterexamples to prove that BLEU is not effective in
reflecting the semantic accuracy of translated code and in comparing
different SMT-based code migration systems. Our empirical study
illustrated that BLEU has weak correlation with human judgment in the
task of measuring semantics of translated source code. Also, BLEU's
decision on the difference between models' translation quality is
inconsistent with that from semantic scores. We concluded that BLEU is
not suitable for source code migration, and proposed a new alternative
metric {\model} to replace BLEU. {\model} is a novel ensemble metric
that takes into account three representation levels of source code. We
validated {\model} on multiple SMT-based code migration models to show
its reliability in estimating semantic accuracy and comparing
translation quality between those models. {\model} is always definable
for any code fragment even when AST or PDG representations cannot be
built. With its advantages, {\model} can be used to evaluate
SMT-based code migration~models.
