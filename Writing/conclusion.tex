\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, in this work, we conducted study to invalidate the use of BLEU for SMT-based Code Migration system. Our counterexamples proved that an improvement in BLEU is not sufficient nor necessary to improve translation quality. Our empirical study showed that BLEU has weak correlation with human judgment in the task of measuring semantics of translated source code. We concluded that BLEU is not suitable for source code, and proposed a new alternative metric {\model} to replace BLEU. {\model} is a combination metric that takes into account three levels representation of source code. We validated {\model} on practical Code Migration systems to show its reliability on estimating semantic accuracy of translated source code as well as its viable regardless of systems and programming languages.
