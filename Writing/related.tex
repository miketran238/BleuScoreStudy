\section{Related Work}

There exist
many studies aiming to measure the functionality similarity of source
code, which utilize the similarities of structures and
dependencies~\cite{clone-tse07,roy09,baker97,ccfinder,cpminer,deckard,deckard2,horwitz01}.

However, they are not reliable as their results sometimes contradict
with human judgments on semantic accuracy~\cite{deckard2}.
