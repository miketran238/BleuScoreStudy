\subsection{Data Collection}

For our study, we collected a parallel corpus of \textbf{34,209} pairs
of methods written in both Java and C\texttt{\#}. Those methods were
created manually by developers, and used in 9 open-source systems that
were originally developed in Java and then ported to
C\texttt{\#}. They are well-recognized systems such that both Java and
C\# versions have been used in practice and research~\cite{ase15}.

Not all of the methods in Java version has a respective one in the
C\texttt{\#} version. To collect respective methods in each pair of
corresponding versions, we built a tool to conservatively search for
only the methods having the same signatures in the classes with the
same/similar names in the same/similar directory structures in both
versions. Such pairs of methods likely implement the same
functionality. We aslo manually verified a small, randomly selected
sample set to have high confidence that the method pairs are in fact
the respective ones. In total, we collected 34,209 respective methods
(Table~\ref{tab:systems}).

We used the chosen SMT-based migration tools described earlier on the
above dataset. We applied ten-fold cross validation by dividing all
aligned methods into ten folds with equal numbers of methods. To
test for a fold, we used the remaining folds for training. The
resulting methods were compared against the referenced ones in the
ground truth.
