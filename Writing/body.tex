\section{Background}
\subsection{Machine Translation and Code Migration}
\subsection{Metrics}
Bleu (bilingual evaluation understudy) uses the modified form of n-grams precision and length difference penalty to evaluate the quality of text generated by MT compared to referenced one.

\section{Research Questions and Hypothesis}
\subsection{RQ1}
Does bleu score reflect semantic meaning of translated source code?
\subsection{RQ2} 
If the answer to RQ1 is 'no', is Bleu correlated to Lexical representation of code?
\subsection{RQ3} 
If the answer to RQ1 is 'no', is Bleu correlated to Syntaxtical representation of code?
\subsection{Our hypothesis}
Our hypothesis is that bleu score does not measure well the closeness in term of semantics between the reference and translated source code. 
\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Proof of Hypothesis}
\subsection{Data Collection}
\subsection{Settings and Metrics}
\section{Evaluation}
Since Bleu score is not suitable for SE task (code migration), we propose a new metric RUBY to evaluate quality of machine translation.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.
