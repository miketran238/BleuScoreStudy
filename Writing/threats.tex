\subsection{Threats to Validity}

The dataset of 9 subject projects with +34K method pairs that we used
in our experiments might not be representative. However, it has been
used to evaluate SMT-based migration models in existing
work~\cite{fse13,ase15,icsme16}. For {\model}, it is impossible to
perform the experiments on all migration models from any programming
language to another. We mitigate this threat by using it
on the most popular SMT-based migration models and from Java to
C\texttt{\#}.
